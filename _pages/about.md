:wave: Hi, I’m Madden Zhang, a graduate of Beijing University of Electronic Science and Technology, where I obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Electronic Information Engineering. With 13 years of professional experience, I previously served as an architect at JD.com. Currently, I work at an InsurTech company, focusing on the design and development of risk control engines.

My expertise primarily lies in the development of large-scale distributed systems for e-commerce platforms and rule engine systems. I have extensive experience in core payment and settlement systems, as well as in system optimization and stability enhancement. I am passionate about sharing knowledge and contributing to the field.
